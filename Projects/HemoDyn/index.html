<h3>An innovative PINNs application prototype</h3>

<h4>Neural networks or physiological networks?</h4>
<p>When a knowledge gap must be bridged using machine learning, which would you prefer: a traditional neural network or a physiological-model-informed network? While neural networks are powerful, they often require a large number of nodes (and therefore a large amount of training data) to perform well. This not only increases the sample burden but also reduces transparency, as their internal logic remains largely opaque. In contrast, a physiological network uses fewer, well-defined nodes grounded in known mechanisms (such as a validated physiological model) making it both more interpretable and more sample-efficient.</p>
<p>Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been widely playing significant roles in Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE). In principle, the hemodynamics CFD should be able to play a role in dealing with vascular diseases. If the hemodynamics CFD has to play a role, should we follow the strategy how CFD is played in CAE? As a computational scientist and algorithm developer, I have long noticed the vast waste of computational resources on proccessal accurracy, rather than used on final accurracy.</p>
<p>It is a reality that the hemodynamic CFD has long been overshadowed by its industrial counterpart due to lower accuracy, but it is not rational in my opinion. The value of a model lies in both knowledge and numerical precision. It is wise to balance computational </p>

<p>In the same principle of CAE, the hemodynamics CFD should be able to play a role in bridging the knowledge gap between vascular physiologcal metrics and a disease severity. In Avoiding the complex explanation based on optics, I'd rather to follow the methodology of PINNs to term the HemoDyn method as Physiological-Model Informed Neural Networks (PMINNs) — a specialized subclass of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) tailored for medical applications.</p>

<h4>Why I Created HemoDyn</h4>
<p>Traditional clinical trial analysis relies heavily on statistical inference from large populations. Machine learning offers promise but suffers from the black-box problem — especially in medicine where explainability and trust are non-negotiable. On the other hand, physiological models are transparent but computationally costly and uncertain, particularly compared to industrial CFD.</p>

<p>Recognizing these trade-offs, I asked:</p>

<p>Can we simulate individual physiological responses efficiently and use them to reduce trial sample sizes?</p>

<p>PMINNs are my answer: an architecture where neural network nodes represent physiological mechanisms (e.g. blood flow, oxygen transport, muscular consumption), and machine learning fills in uncertain parts while obeying biological constraints. This hybrid structure maintains scientific rigor while enabling real-time adaptability.</p>

<p>To move beyond the whiteboard, I built HemoDyn, a PMINN-driven simulation platform specifically designed for clinical trials targeting Lower Extremity Arterial Occlusive Disease (LEAO) — a chronic vascular disease that limits walking ability in elderly patients.</p>

<p>The prototype includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>1D Hemodynamics Solver: using SimVascular's ROM framework to model arterial blood flow.</li>
<li>Oxygen Dynamics Model: built with Elmer Multiphysics to simulate oxygen delivery, exchange, and consumption in muscle tissue.</li>
<li>Wearable Integration: the model consumes real-world pulse data from smartwatches (e.g. Apple Watch) and fingertip oximeters.</li>
<li>Machine Learning Layer: neural networks trained on trial outcomes (e.g. walking distance, ABI) parameterize physiological uncertainties.</li>
<li>Live Feedback: the system updates predictions dynamically as new biosignals arrive, enabling early detection of intervention effects.</li>
</ul>

<h4>What Makes HemoDyn Unique</h4>
<p>HemoDyn is not just an instantiation of PMINN, i.e. not just another machine learning architecture. They represent a methodological shift:</p>

<ul>
<li>Nodes are not abstract units but grounded in physiology.</li>
<li>Predictions are interpretable because they map to known biological processes.</li>
<li>The model reduces uncertainty by combining measured signals with physics-informed structure.</li>
</ul>

<p>In my LEAO prototype, this means:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fewer patients are needed to observe treatment effects.</li>
<li>Clinicians can understand why the model predicts a change.</li>
<li>Trials are faster, cheaper, and more aligned with personalized care.</li>
</ul>

<h4>HemoDyn Outlook</h4>
<p>HemoDyn demonstrates that PMINNs can be a game changer for early-phase clinical trials. Immediate benefits include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Smaller sample sizes without compromising statistical power.</li>
<li>Physiological personalization from day one.</li>
<li>Faster iteration between treatment and feedback.</li>
</ul>

<p>Future extensions of HemoDyn:</p>

<ul>
<li>Chronic disease monitoring (e.g. diabetes, heart failure).</li>
<li>Drug efficacy evaluation with real-time biomarkers.</li>
<li>Integration with EHRs and genomic profiles for richer modeling.</li>
</ul>

<p>HemoDyn offers hope of breaking through the diagnostic and treatment stalemate.</p> 
<p>When elderly people struggle to walk, many assume it's simply due to natural aging. In reality, a large portion of these cases stem from blood flow problems. LEAO is the leading cause of walking difficulties among the elderly, accounting for nearly half of all cases. Data shows that around 12% of "young-old" individuals aged about 65 suffer from LEAO, and the prevalence rises to 50% in those over 80. This is a chronic condition with major impact that has long been neglected.</p>
<p>Currently, except in rare cases that require surgery, most interventions for LEAO—such as medication or catheter-based procedures—are difficult to evaluate in the short term. This makes it hard for doctors to quickly determine treatment effectiveness, and for pharmaceutical companies to efficiently screen new drugs. This evaluation bottleneck is at the heart of why LEAO is considered a "diagnostic and treatment deadlock."</p>
<p>By leveraging a smartwatch at the center of a closed-loop system that integrates artificial intelligence and physiological modeling, it enables digital tracking of the condition and rapid feedback on treatment effects. The mechanism is simple: the watch automatically records pulse and blood oxygen levels. In addition, a fingertip pulse oximeter is used twice daily—once at rest and once after activity (such as a brisk 15-minute walk). The data is uploaded to the cloud, where the system models and analyzes it, providing real-time feedback on trends.</p>
<p>As a result, the effectiveness of interventions can become "visible" within just a few days or weeks.</p>
