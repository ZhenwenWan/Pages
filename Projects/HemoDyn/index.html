<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<h4>Motivation</h4>
<p>I am a simulation expert with a background in modeling, data assimilation, optimization, and machine learning. I believe that individual-specific hemodynamics models can transform healthcare. Among various application areas, clinical trials—particularly for chronic vascular diseases—offer the fastest path to real-world impact.</p>
<p>These models can reduce the sample size needed to evaluate medical interventions. Though less precise than industrial CFD, they capture meaningful physiological insights. This project uses Lower Extremity Artery Occlusion (LEAO) as a use case.</p>
<h4>Trial Framing: Strategy A vs. B</h4>
<p>Two trial strategies are compared:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strategy A:</strong> Two groups are monitored (with/without intervention); walking distance is the primary metric.</li>
<li><strong>Strategy B:</strong> Same walking data is collected, but a hemodynamics model also is extended to simulate muscular oxygen concentration based on wearable data.</li>
</ul>
<p>While Strategy B introduces modeling uncertainties, it enables early learning, physiological personalization, and potential mathematical superiority.</p>
<h4>Use Case Justification</h4>
<p>LEAO is an ideal entry point: common, quantifiable, and moderate. Traditional severity metrics like arterial narrowing are hard to measure directly. Hemodynamic simulation offers a way to track disease progression and intervention impact.</p>
<h4>Prototype Overview: HemoDyn</h4>
<p><strong>HemoDyn</strong> simulates blood and oxygen dynamics using:</p>
<ul>
<li>1D ROM solver from SimVascular for hemodynamics</li>
<li>Elmer Multiphysics solvers for oxygen transport, transmembrane exchange and consumption</li>
<li>Wearable pulse data (e.g., Apple Watch) and oximeter readings</li>
</ul>
<p>ML maps oxygen dynamics to clinical outcomes like walking distance.</p>
<h4>Implementation Steps</h4>
<ol>
<li>Create simplified leg model with vessels and muscles</li>
<li>Mesh with Gmsh and convert using ElmerGrid</li>
<li>Configure ElmerSolver (ModelPDE, HeatSolve)</li>
<li>Run SimVascular ROM and ElmerSolver</li>
<li>Visualize results with VTK</li>
<li>Develop sliders for vascular sections and muscle positions</li>
</ol>

<h3>The innovative method</h3>
<p>To assess the effectiveness of medical interventions for Lower Extremity Arterial Occlusive disease (LEAO) during clinical trials, I propose an innovative modeling approach that reduces reliance on conventional functional outcome data by directly estimating oxygen concentration in muscle tissue.
</p>
<p>The core of this method is a reduced-order physiological model that simulates oxygen dynamics, including:
</p>
<p>-Hemodynamic transport
</p>
<p>-Transmembrane oxygen exchange
</p>
<p>-Muscular oxygen consumption
</p>
<p>To achieve real-time performance, I applied dimensional reduction techniques and spatial abstraction to the muscle domain. This simplification introduces additional degrees of uncertainty due to underdetermined parameters. However, it enables efficient assimilation of real-time physiological data such as:
</p>
<p>-Pulse waveforms from wearable devices (e.g., Apple Watch)
</p>
<p>-Intermittent readings from toe-tip oximeters
</p>
<p>This model operates under a data assimilation framework, dynamically integrating observed biosignals to update internal states and improve prediction fidelity.
</p>
<p>To handle model uncertainties and individual variability, I parameterize uncertain physiological components using neural networks, which are trained using conventional clinical data (e.g., walking distance, ABI, or imaging-derived perfusion metrics). In doing so, I effectively embed a learned closure model within the physics-based simulation—analogous to the concept of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).
</p>
<p>While the overall framework extends beyond standard PINNs, it embodies their central philosophy: learning from data while enforcing known physical laws. Thus, it may be best described as a hybrid PINN-based data-driven physiological modeling platform tailored for vascular health assessment and therapy evaluation.
</p>
<p>This approach offers a promising path to improve the precision and scalability of early-phase clinical trials by:
</p>
<p>-Reducing dependence on labor-intensive outcome measurements
</p>
<p>-Enabling individualized response modeling
</p>
<p>-Accelerating feedback cycles in intervention optimization
</p>

<h3>Outlook</h3>
<p>When elderly people struggle to walk, many assume it's simply due to natural aging. In reality, a large portion of these cases stem from blood flow problems. Lower limb arterial occlusion (also known as lower extremity atherosclerosis, LEAO) is the leading cause of walking difficulties among the elderly, accounting for nearly half of all cases. Data shows that around 12% of “young-old” individuals aged about 65 suffer from LEAO, and the prevalence rises to 50% in those over 80. This is a chronic condition with major impact that has long been neglected.</p>
<p>Currently, except in rare cases that require surgery, most interventions for LEAO—such as medication or catheter-based procedures—are difficult to evaluate in the short term. This makes it hard for doctors to quickly determine treatment effectiveness, and for pharmaceutical companies to efficiently screen new drugs. This evaluation bottleneck is at the heart of why LEAO is considered a "diagnostic and treatment deadlock."</p>
<p>Now, hemodynamic digital technology offers hope of breaking through this stalemate.</p>
<p>By leveraging a smartwatch at the center of a closed-loop system that integrates artificial intelligence and physiological modeling, it enables digital tracking of the condition and rapid feedback on treatment effects. The mechanism is simple: the watch automatically records pulse and blood oxygen levels. In addition, a fingertip pulse oximeter is used twice daily—once at rest and once after activity (such as a brisk 15-minute walk). The data is uploaded to the cloud, where the system models and analyzes it, providing real-time feedback on trends.</p>
<p>As a result, the effectiveness of interventions can become “visible” within just a few days or weeks.</p>
