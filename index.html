                <p>My CFD career features a unique combo of research and development. Research on oceanography over twenty years helped me to develop a profound sense of innovation and verification. I am a little special in CFD-based oceanic multiphysics modelling and simulation, and have coauthored dozens of research articles. In recent years, I have employed myself. I am experienced to attract commercial development projects remotely and to implement the tasks myself. 

Are there any CFD application scenarios yet to be attempted? It will be a challenge to name one which may involve CFD directly but yet has been attempted. I think there are still vast virginias which CFD play roles indirectly. To reduce clinical sample sizes might be considered one, namely HemoDyn which I prototyped, dedicated to assessing clinical effects. The logic behind is machine learning data features reflected with hemodynamic CFD parameters. Deep Learning crossing CFD is involved here.

Navigating AI assistants to develop an industrial rate application from scratch might become one of popular competences in the future. While attracting diverse commercial development projects, I focus on developing skills to navigate AI assistants. BSMesher is an industrial-grade software which I developed from scratch within only four months, which could easily take dozens of man-years without AI assistance. BSMesher was released for free downloading.

                    <p>HemoDyn aims to simulate blood flow and physiological dynamics for boosting bioengineering development and assessing the effects of medical intervention. The preliminary goal is to reduce the sample size in clinical trials for LEAO. Oxygen concentration in leg muscles is the selected bioinfo for measuring the severity of LEAO. ML is employed to map oxygen with functional index, e.g. walk distance. Oxygen comes from a physiological model which connects a vascular hemodynamics model. The hemodynamics model is driven by pulse data from wearable devices, e.g. Apple Watch, while assimilating other data, like readings from a toe-tip oximeter. The hemodynaimcs model is solved by the 1D ROM solver of SimVascular. The physiological model of oxgen allows for transport, transmembrane exchange and muscular consumption, and it is solved by multiple solvers from Elmer Multiphysics. VTK is used to animate model results. An API to access pulse data from wearable devices and functionalities to faciliate machine learning is being developed. <a href="Projects/HemoDyn/index.html" class="highlight-link">More...</a></p>
